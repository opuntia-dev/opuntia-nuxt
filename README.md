## Quick Start

[![Deploy to Netlify Button](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/opuntia-dev/opuntia-nuxt)

Click this button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify.

If you just want to develop locally, you can [create a repo](https://github.com/opuntia-dev/opuntia-nuxt/generate) from this template on GitHub.

## Usage

Just run and visit http://localhost:1977.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

To build the App, you can run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You will then see the `dist` folder generated for publishing, which you can preview locally with the following command.

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Clean Template

If you prefer to do it manually with the cleaner git history:

```bash
npx degit opuntia-dev/opuntia-nuxt opuntia-app

cd opuntia-app

pnpm i # If you don't have pnpm installed, run: npm install -g pnpm
```

When you use this template, try follow the checklist to update your info properly:

- [ ] Change the author name in `LICENSE`.
- [ ] Change the title in `locales/*.json` and `VITE_APP_DEFAULT_TITLE` env.
- [ ] Change the favicon in `public` and remove preview image.
- [ ] Remove the `.github` folder which contains the funding info.
